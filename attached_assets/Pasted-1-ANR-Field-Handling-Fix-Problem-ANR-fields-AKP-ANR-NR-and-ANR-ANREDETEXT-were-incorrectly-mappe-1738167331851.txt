1. ANR Field Handling Fix
Problem: ANR fields (AKP_ANR_NR and ANR_ANREDETEXT) were incorrectly mapped to deals instead of persons, causing data mismatches.
Proposed Solution:
Correctly map ANR fields to the person entity in create_person():
python
if field_info and field_info['type'] == 'enum':
    # Directly map using the field mapping configuration
    person_data[mapping['target']] = field_value
Review:
This fix ensures that ANR fields are properly assigned to persons, as they logically represent salutation details for individuals.
The removal of hardcoded checks for ANR_ANREDE and ANR_ANREDETEXT improves maintainability by relying on the field mapping configuration.
2. Remove Incorrect Deal Field Assignments
Problem: ANR fields were mistakenly added to deal data, which is irrelevant.
Proposed Solution:
Remove these lines from create_deal():
python
if anr_nr:
    deal_data['031ae26196cff3bf754a3fa9ff701f13c73113bf'] = str(anr_nr)
if anredetext:
    deal_data['2fea5d7de9997e5a2e32befbe45bf8a145373754'] = anredetext
Review:
This is a necessary cleanup step to prevent irrelevant data from being included in deals.
Ensures that deal objects remain focused on project-related information rather than personal salutation details.
3. Simplified Deal Status Handling
Problem: The current implementation uses overly complex logic for status sequencing and manual time setting.
Proposed Solution:
Replace the status handling block with a simplified update:
python
if result.get('success'):
    deal_id = result['data']['id']
    update_endpoint = f"{self.base_url}/deals/{deal_id}"

    # Set final status in a single update
    status_data = {}
    if data.get('NPO_ASumme'):
        status_data['status'] = 'won'
    elif str(data.get('Status')) == '4':
        status_data['status'] = 'lost'
    
    if status_data:
        requests.put(update_endpoint, params=params, json=status_data)
Review:
This approach reduces complexity by directly setting the final status (won or lost) after deal creation.
Eliminates redundant steps like clearing existing times or unnecessary delays (time.sleep()).
However, ensure that won_time and lost_time updates are handled separately after this step if required.
4. Field Mapping Validation
Verification: Ensure all mappings in uniska_field_mappings.json align with Pipedrive field IDs.
Review:
The mappings appear consistent and correctly associate Abacus fields (e.g., NPO_ProjNr, ADR_NAME) with their corresponding Pipedrive custom fields or native fields.
Adding validation during field mapping loading (e.g., checking if target IDs exist in Pipedrive) would further enhance robustness.
5. Add Field Mapping Debugging
Problem: Lack of visibility into mapping errors makes troubleshooting difficult.
Proposed Solution:
Add debugging logs when loading mappings:
python
def _load_field_mappings(self):
    """Load field mappings from file."""
    try:
        with open(self.mapping_file, 'r') as f:
            self.field_mappings = json.load(f)
        logger.debug(f"Loaded field mappings: {self.field_mappings}")
    except (FileNotFoundError, json.JSONDecodeError) as e:
        logger.error(f"Error loading field mappings: {str(e)}")
        self.field_mappings = []
Review:
This is a straightforward and effective solution to improve visibility into potential issues during mapping initialization.
Ensures that any errors (e.g., missing or malformed mapping files) are logged for easier debugging.
Critical Implementation Notes
Data Flow Order:
The sequence of creating organizations → persons → deals must be strictly maintained to ensure proper linking between entities.
Example: A person must have a valid org_id before being created, and a deal must have both a linked organization and person.
API Timing:
Remove all time.sleep() calls as they are unreliable for managing API timing. Instead, rely on proper sequencing and response validation before proceeding to the next step.
Error Handling:
Add validation checks before making API calls to ensure
