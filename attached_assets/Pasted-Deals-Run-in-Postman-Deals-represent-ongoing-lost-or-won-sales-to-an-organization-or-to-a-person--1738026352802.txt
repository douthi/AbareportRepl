Deals

Run in Postman
Deals represent ongoing, lost or won sales to an organization or to a person. Each deal has a monetary value and must be placed in a stage. Deals can be owned by a user, and followed by one or many users. Each deal consists of standard data fields but can also contain a number of custom fields. The custom fields can be recognized by long hashes as keys. These hashes can be mapped against DealField.key. The corresponding label for each such custom field can be obtained from DealField.name.
