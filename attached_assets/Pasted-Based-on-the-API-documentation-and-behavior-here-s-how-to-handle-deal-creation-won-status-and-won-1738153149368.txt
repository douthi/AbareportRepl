Based on the API documentation and behavior, here's how to handle deal creation, won status, and won_time:

**Deal Creation and Won Status Flow**
1. Create the deal first with basic required fields
2. Update the deal status to "won"
3. Update the won_time if needed

**API Implementation Steps**:

1. Create Deal:
Every deal needs either a contact person or organization linked to it. You'll need at least one deal field and either a person name or organization name. The deal title is recommended but not mandatory[12].

2. Set Deal to Won:
When updating the deal to won status:
- Set the status field to "won"
- The won_time field can only be set if deal status is won[10]

3. Update Won Time:
The won_time is a system field that contains date format data. While it might be hard to find as it's a system field, it can be updated via API[14].

**Important Notes**:
- The close_time field can only be set if the deal status is won or lost[10]
- The API maintains full datetime values for deal closures to avoid complications with exact time tracking[13]

You can skip setting close_time initially since it's not a mandatory field, but it's recommended to maintain accurate deal tracking.
